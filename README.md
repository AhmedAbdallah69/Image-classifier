# 🧠 Image Classification with CNNs & Transfer Learning

This project implements an end-to-end image classification pipeline using **custom CNNs** and **transfer learning models (VGG16, MobileNetV2)** on a dataset of 8 natural image categories.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset is organized into 8 folders, one per category:

```

/airplane
/car
/cat
/dog
/flower
/fruit
/motorbike
/person

```

Each folder contains image files. Images are resized to **150x150** during preprocessing.

## 🧪 Preprocessing

```python
# Image preprocessing:
- Resize to 150x150
- Normalize to [0, 1]
- Save features/labels using pickle
````

Split into:

* **Train**: 70%
* **Validation**: 15%
* **Test**: 15%

Data augmentation includes rotation, shift, shear, zoom, and flips.

## 🏋️ Training

Uses:

* `EarlyStopping` to prevent overfitting
* `ModelCheckpoint` to save best weights

Visualized with:

* Accuracy / loss curves
* Saved to `*.png` files

---

## 📈 Evaluation

Each model is evaluated using:

* ✅ Test accuracy
* 📄 Classification report
* 🧩 Confusion matrix (plotted)
* 🖼️ Sample predictions (with color-coded labels)

Best model is selected based on test accuracy.

---

## 🚀 Inference Pipeline

A reusable function:

```python
def predict_image(image_path):
    ...
```

* Takes a new image
* Preprocesses and predicts
* Displays prediction with confidence

## 🧰 Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib seaborn tqdm tensorflow keras scikit-learn
```
